High voltage power supply
=========================

This circuit implements a high voltage switching mode power supply with
variable output voltage and current limiter. The power supply is based 
on components taken from a former 230V to 15V 25W SMPS which was 
manufactured in the former GDR. The B260D IC can be replaced by
a TDA1060.

ATTENTION: The circuit generates a very high output voltage. 
It can and will cause injury or death on improper use. Take special 
caution when operating this circuit. Build and use on your own risk.
The author is not liable for injury and damage in direct or 
indirect usage of this circuit.
