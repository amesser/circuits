Twilight Switch
===============

This circuit forms a twilight switch made of a few inexpensive parts
running from a 12V to 15V powersupply. The switch is equipped with 
a power mosfet output stage and extended supply voltage filtering
in order to switch high current DC loads.

While the final circuit is made from a CMOS 40106 Hex Schmitt-Trigger
inverter, first ideas where base on CMOS 4007 Tripple Complementary Mos
Transistor Pairs. A schematic of this first attempt is available for
reference.
