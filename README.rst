MPP Solar Battery Charger
=========================

This project is about creating a Maximum Power Point
Solar Battery Charger made of analog components only. I
also tried to use commonly available parts and
renounce using highly integrated and specialized ICs.

The charger uses a DC-DC Converter in Buck topology to
optimize the operating point of the solar panel. The optimal
operating voltage is manually adjustable. The charger will 
not dynamically adapt this voltage. (This would require
a microcontroller)

The circuit is made for 200W solar input power from 
36 cell panels and 12V Lead-Acid Battery. It can be 
easily adapted for other input and battery voltages.
